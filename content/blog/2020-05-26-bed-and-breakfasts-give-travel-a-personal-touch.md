Travelers seeking a personal touch and insider stories would do well to consider staying at a local bed and breakfast (B&B). B&Bs "are more intimate, with much more personal attention," says Sharon Scruggs, who operates the Fife and Drum Inn with her husband, Billy. Both are lifetime residents of Williamsburg, Virginia, and provide a unique and in-depth perspective on the history of the area for their guests. The bed-and-breakfast experience offers many other benefits beyond what travelers find in a chain- hotel setting.

## Location

Many bed and breakfasts are historic properties, often located in the center of scenic areas.The Fife and Drum Inn has been part of Sharon’s family for generations. The building was constructed in 1933 by her grandfather as a combination of stores with apartments above, and is a short walk to the sights and sounds of Colonial Williamsburg, including the holiday Grand Illumination fireworks display.- Character. Part of the charm of a bed and breakfast is the uniqueness; art, décor, and food are integrated to create a complete experience. For example, the Fife and Drum retains the colonial feel of the area in all its guest rooms. Special features include antique furnishings, elegant four poster beds in some guest rooms, as well folk art and artifacts from the restoration period of the historic area available for guests to enjoy.

## Food

Bed and breakfasts don’t shirk the breakfast half of the equation, and the best of them reflect the local cuisine. The Fife and Drum features daily breakfast casseroles based on family recipes to reflect the southern cooking of the area; other items include fresh biscuits, Virginia ham, fruit, and a unique blend of granola to fuel a day of sightseeing.

## Customization.

Not only do visitors to a bed and breakfast get a unique perspective on the place they are visiting, they have options for special packages not available in other hotel settings. 

Bed and breakfasts can partner easily with local businesses for a smoothly organized and highly personalized vacation experience.The Fife and Drum Inn offers options such as the Historic Triangle Package that includes three nights at the Inn, breakfasts, and admissions to historic Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown. Bed and breakfasts also lend themselves to romance. Helpful hosts can design guest packages built around proposals, anniversaries, or just a special getaway.
